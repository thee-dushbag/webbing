        <p>
          <span>From fairest creatures we desire increase,</span>
          <span>That thereby beauty's rose might never die,</span>
          <span>But as the riper should by time decease,</span>
          <span>His tender heir might bear his memory:</span>
          <span>But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,</span>
          <span>Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,</span>
          <span>Making a famine where abundance lies,</span>
          <span>Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:</span>
          <span>Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,</span>
          <span>And only herald to the gaudy spring,</span>
          <span>Within thine own bud buriest thy content,</span>
          <span>And, tender churl, mak'st waste in niggarding:</span>
          <span>Pity the world, or else this glutton be,</span>
