# Webbing <sub><sub>üåè</sub></sub>

A little frontend never hurts.

This repo is an attempt to understand a little bit of design and graphical user interfaces. Creating a simple beautiful website has always been a dream to be fulfilled, a journey to be travelled.

Though I deeply hate javascript (not like that though), it simply lacks everything, even a good syntax analyzer or intellisense (which are totally useless for minified javascript), but I'm willing to look at it enough to call my self an ametuer website designer/creator. A way represent my documents with a good taste.

## Tools
The main focus will be aiohttp, alpinejs, bootstrap, htmx, html, css and a tiny bit of javascript.

I will also keep track of a book am reading `Tiny CSS projects` by `Martine` and `Michael`. It seems cool and enough to get busy with CSS.
